# Parking-Lot-Low-Level-Design
The aim is to design a parking lot system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and SOLID principles in C++. 
It defines classes for different types of vehicles, such as cars and bikes, and classes for different types of payment structures, such as hourly and handicapped rates.

The system is designed to be scalable, efficient, secure, reliable, and user-friendly. Additionally, it has been created keeping in mind maintainability, reusability, and testability

Functional Requirements for Parking Lot:
1. The following is a list of functional requirements for a parking lot system:
2. The parking lot system should be able to park cars, bikes, and handicapped vehicles.
3. The system should be able to calculate the cost of parking for each type of vehicle.
4. The system should be able to keep track of the time a vehicle is parked.
5. The system should be able to remove a vehicle from a parking spot.
6. The system should be able to check the availability of parking spots and handicapped spots on a specific floor.
7. The system should be able to calculate the number of hours a vehicle has been parked.
